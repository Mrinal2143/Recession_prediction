This project aims to enhance the predictability of recession in the US, by integrating a news sentiment index, with traditional economic indicators.
The sentiment index is derived from news data, collected for topics like economy, stock, and data of Federal Open Market committee minutes.
The models aim to predict recessionary and non-recessionary periods in the United States, with the NBER data  serving as a benchmark for validation.
